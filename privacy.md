### 1. Data Collection and Use
* **Camera Access:** The App requires access to your camera to take photos of food ingredients.
* **Temporary Cloud Storage:** Images are uploaded to a secure, private **Google Cloud Storage** bucket. This is used solely for the technical transit of the image to the AI for processing.
* **AI Processing:** We utilize the **Google Gemini API** to analyze these images. 
* **Automatic Deletion:** Images are stored only temporarily and are automatically deleted immediately after the recipe is generated. We do not maintain a permanent database of your photos.

### 2. Subscription Management
* We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions. All financial transactions are processed securely by the Apple App Store. We do not store or have access to your credit card information.

### 3. Third-Party Services
* Aside from Google Gemini (for image analysis, recipe/image generation) and RevenueCat (for subscriptions), we do not share your personal data with third parties.

### 4. Data Security
* We implement standard security measures to protect the information transmitted through the App. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
